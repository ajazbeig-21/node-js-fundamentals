/*
global dependancy
--> use than package in any project

npm install -g nodemon

this command will install nodemon package globally

npx  --->  directly using the package without installing it globally



package versions have 3 parts

Major Version    Minir version(backward compatible)      patch for                                                       fix
2.               0.                                      18

"devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.18"
  }
}

if Major version changes we have to update the package coz it have large breaing changes.
