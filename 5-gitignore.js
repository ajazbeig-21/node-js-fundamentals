/*
git provides us the .gitignore to avoid some files to be get pushed to the repo like node_modules.

so first we need to create the .gitignore file on root folder

add filename/folder name to hide from commits

just add that file commit and push that file only.

and then afterwords not file will get commited that are in .gitignore file
